<details>
<summary>What is ReactJS?</summary>

React creates a virtual DOM, made of a series of nested components, then mounts that to the HTML DOM. When state is changed, it first uses "diffing" to identify what has been changed, then "reconciles" the changes to the DOM by only re-rendering those differences.

<summary>What are the core features of React?</summary>

React creates a virtual DOM, made of a series of nested components, then mounts that to the HTML DOM. When state is changed, it first uses "diffing" to identify what has been changed, then "reconciles" the changes to the DOM by only re-rendering those differences.

<summary>What is the key to React data flow?</summary>
